The HOW is in the original post if you're curious enough to search.  Something else I learned about myself, if you're familiar with Human Design, my strongest sense is inner vision. The Human Design app describes it as: the only sense not derived from the outside world, but from within your minds eye. Inner Vision, your superpower is shaping and molding something in your imagination so clearly that it comes into physical reality in the best way possible.  Again, I have aphantasia... I can't really visually picture things... but I have discovered that what happens instead is, when I imagine, say a tree. I can feel how tall it is, I can feel what color it is, the texture of the bark, I can hear the breeze, and I can feel the air around it.  Then, I learned that many people with dyslexia are more likely to think in 3D images and pictures than people without dyslexia.¬†maybe it's related... maybe not ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è But I will forever be fascinated by learning more about myself, about the mind, the body, and what it is to be alive. ‚ú®Ô∏è #artist #digitalart #tarotcards #tarot #tarotwithplayingcards #glitchart #intuitive #intuitiveart #intuitiveartists #divination #divinationtools #learning #healingjourney #sixofhearts #sixofcups ",705,4,0,0,0,"artist,learning,digitalart,tarot,tarotcards,glitchart,divination,intuitive,sixofhearts,divinationtools,sixofcups,healingjourney,intuitiveart,intuitiveartists,tarotwithplayingcards",https://www.tiktok.com/@kmhealingarts/video/7414565310889544990

The HOW is in the original post if you're curious enough to search.  So there's this thing about me that is hard to explain.  I have aphantasia, synesthesia, and dyslexia. I also have a delay in language processing... I'm sure that has a hard to spell word, too....  So, my thoughts are often much more abstract than anything I say. It's like I have to translate it from something else into language just in my head.  This is where art has been an absolute game changer, life saver... absolute necessity. This is also where learning and facilitating NLP and hypnosis has helped me find language for my experience.  So when I don't have the words... I draw about it. ‚ú®Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è #artist #digitalart #tarotcards #tarot #tarotwithplayingcards #glitchart #intuitive #intuitiveart #intuitiveartists #divination #divinationtools #learning #healingjourney #queenofclubs #queenofwands ",691,4,2,0,0,"artist,learning,queenofclubs,digitalart,tarot,tarotcards,glitchart,divination,intuitive,divinationtools,queenofwands,healingjourney,intuitiveart,intuitiveartists,tarotwithplayingcards",https://www.tiktok.com/@kmhealingarts/video/7414306091850370334

I completed the Owlympics August Challenge on Duolingo. I had to play 3 friend quests plus regular daily quests to get the badge, it was a strenuous badge to get. We needed to get 50 points to acheive it. I'm so happy I got the Owlympics badge.

I watched an episode of Scan My Brain from Dr. Daniel Amen of Amen Clinics.  He helped a billionaire's son who who was experiencing panic attacks; some of it because he used to use drugs. He was also identifying with him, and helping him because he was the son of a billonaire, that felt like he could not live up to his father's accomplishments. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FEq48lMBgw 4. I watched a cool video from the aphantasia network channel on youtube, Dr. Paolo Bartolomeo  explained that after a stroke some people can only visualize half of one side of an image. I also learned that in people with aphantasia two parts of the brain  don't synchronize like other people without aphantasia, when they are trying to visualize something. Dr. Paolo Bartolomeo also explained a difference between congenital and acquired aphantasia in the brain, but I already forgot what it was. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3coZKfePBU  #americanidol #duolingo #owlympics #augustchallenge #challenge #danielamen #amenclinics #scanmybrain #brain #brainhealth #aphantasia #congenitalaphantasia #acquiredaphantasia #imaginalneglect #stroke  #podcastshow #newpodcast #podcasters #newepisode #podcasthost #podcasts #podcasting #podcastersoftiktok #podcastlife #podcastmovement #podcastcommunity",119,1,0,0,90,"americanidol,stroke,challenge,brain,newepisode,podcasts,duolingo,augustchallenge,danielamen,podcasting,podcasters,brainhealth,podcastshow,newpodcast,aphantasia,podcastlife,congenitalaphantasia,podcastersoftiktok,podcasthost,podcastmovement,podcastcommunity,amenclinics,owlympics,scanmybrain,imaginalneglect,acquiredaphantasia",https://www.tiktok.com/@gabriellalaplace/video/7407471531149790469

There isn't a TW page for this book, and honestly I can't blame the author. The list would probably be half the book. There is a warning in the beginning that says ""This story is not for the faint of heart"", take that very seriously. In the beginning I had to put the book down after each chapter, just because of how intense it was. After those, I couldn't stop, I had to know what was coming next. Problem; I'm a chicken and can't read horror at night. Which means it took me longer than I wanted. It's definitely a book that I could've read in a day if I was allowed to do nothing with no interruptions. The world building seems pretty solid. There is so much detail about anything and everything. At least the words make it out to be that. I, however, have aphantasia. If you don't know what it is, look it up. I'm on a word cap here. I would not have been able to read this book if I could have visualized it. The author did give the characters so much life, that you could almost feel what they were feeling. Not that you'd want to. I guess it was more sympathy or even empathy. It's a perfect book for both visual and nonvisual people. My heart was pounding with anticipation. This is probably one of the most graphic books I've ever read, and I loved every single second of it. I've never read a book like this before or something even close to this plot. A new unique story was just what I needed. It's also incredibly heartbreaking on top of being absolutely disgusting, brutal, graphic, and gory. Now were there mistakes that beta, ARC, or the editor should have caught? 100% yes. Did it take me away from this journey? No. As I've said before, this story is so unique and captured me from the beginning. I'm almost positive it will be one of my favorite reads of the year. I know as of now, it is. Will this leave me with a hangover? Yea.

This means that people with aphantasia do not have the ability to create mental images in their mind's eye, something that most people can do quite naturally. For example, if you were to close your eyes and try to picture a beach, most people can see the waves, the sand, and the sky in their mind. However, someone with aphantasia would not be able to form such a visual image. This condition can affect various aspects of life, including memory, imagination, and even dreaming. People with aphantasia often rely more on other senses and forms of thinking, such as verbal or logical reasoning, to process information. While it might seem like a significant limitation, many individuals with aphantasia lead perfectly normal lives and may not even realize they have the condition until later in life. Research into aphantasia is still ongoing, and scientists are continually learning more about how it affects the brain and cognition.",91,3,0,0,0,,https://www.tiktok.com/@swanginmyjohnson/video/7418733032514817326

NLP is a technique that you can use to create an anchor, or trigger, to access a network of related neuronal activity, which you train into your nervous system through repetition. This is based on what is called Hebbian learning, which is a neuroscience principle that explains how we pair stimuli. Here‚Äôs how to sidestep aphantasia to and use neuroscience to access your inner resources of positive feelings, whenever you need them. If recalling other senses than just visual is difficult for you, set your NLP anchor during actual experiences of connection and security. #nlp #neurolinguisticprogramming #relationshiptips #relationshipadvice #anxiousattachment #anxiousattachmentstyle #attachmentissues #manifestation #aphantasia ",506,9,5,0,27,"attachmentissues,relationshipadvice,relationshiptips,manifestation,nlp,aphantasia,neurolinguisticprogramming,anxiousattachment,anxiousattachmentstyle",https://www.tiktok.com/@innerzenly/video/7416794011739950366

Some people have no mental imagery at all, while others may have limited visualization abilities.    - üí≠ Inner Monologue: The stream of verbal thoughts that some people constantly experience in their minds. For some, this inner narrative is always present, while others may experience it sporadically or not at all. - üé∂ Inner Audio to Image Converter: The ability to listen to music or sounds and automatically form vivid mental pictures. Some people can ""see"" a song's story unfold in their mind, connecting sound and imagery in a creative and emotional way. - üåü Developing Mental Imagery: Even if you have aphantasia or a weak inner monologue, you can improve these abilities with mindfulness, meditation, and creative visualization exercises. By practicing listening to music and consciously forming mental images, you can strengthen the link between sound and visuals in your mind. - üîë Unlocking Creativity: These skills not only help with visualization but also enhance creativity, memory, and emotional expression, allowing you to connect more deeply with your inner world.

I wrote this one after finding out that ""picture this in your mind,"" or ""visualize this"" phrases were not just metaphors; that people actually see things in their minds. I always thought visualizing things in your mind was just an expression, but I found out I actually have aphantasia (the lack of mind's eye). When I try to imagine things, I see nothing.  This poem is an expression of the feeling I got after that realization. I asked myself what would happen to my memories? What will become of the memories I made with people I value the most? What about their faces? These questions made me overthink a lot of things, and I figured I had to find a way to express it, and this poem was the result. visit @fuwafuwa (comms open) more artworks! #originalpoem #poetrytok #wordswordswords #poemsfromthenotesapp #Poems #aphantasia #poemaboutaphantasia #aphantasiagang #aphantasiaartist ",355,18,3,0,0,"poems,wordswordswords,originalpoem,aphantasia,poetrytok,aphantasiagang,aphantasiaartist,poemsfromthenotesapp,sorry_laters,poemaboutaphantasia",https://www.tiktok.com/@poetato.jam/video/7415612608369151250

7429447997009693958,green19ranger,1729803168,za,"someone with hyperphantasia, who experiences highly vivid mental imagery, could likely create a rich and detailed paracosm‚Äîa complex, fictional world in their mind. In theory, this vivid worldbuilding could serve as a setting for lucid dreaming or astral projection, though these experiences rely on different techniques. ‚Ä¢ Lucid Dreaming: In a lucid dream, where the dreamer is aware they are dreaming and can influence the dream, a person with hyperphantasia may be able to consciously transport themselves into the paracosm they've imagined. Lucid dreaming techniques like reality checks, dream journaling, and meditation can help in achieving this. ‚Ä¢ Astral Projection: This is a more metaphysical or spiritual practice, involving the sensation of the soul or consciousness leaving the body to explore other planes of existence. While the experience of astral projection is subjective, people who believe in it often report traveling to places they've imagined or created. Hyperphantasia could enhance the vividness of the experience, though astral projection itself is less scientifically verified than lucid dreaming. Both require practice in controlling and directing one's mental focus. Someone with hyperphantasia may have an advantage in visualization, which could make the experience more vivid and immersive.

One day I came back home & and they were in a bag on shelf - as if we hadn‚Äôt looked there before. my memory has been robbed from me due to ptsd, making these tapes the most valuable thing I own.  I have been writing poetry to go along with the tapes my grandpa filmed during the 60s, 70s & 80s. When I first discovered anemoia, I had felt it from as early as I can remember. I have always been fascinated with nostalgia and the feelings that come with nostalgia, but to feel it for something you‚Äôve never experienced (or maybe you have?) and have it be connected to your family is very special to me.  && having aphantasia makes photography, videography & writing the only thing I care about these days.

7445088713429765383,caromccourtie7,1733444802,NZ,"Close your eyes, imagine an apple. Which one of these images do you see? I was blown away to learn this week that the majority can typically see some form of apple (1-4). I see 5 - nothing  I always thought when we closed our eyes, we imagined the object or situation,  That we knew what an apple is, and what it looks like, But we didn‚Äôt actually see it as a picture in our minds eye! If we see nothing (5), this is called Aphantasia. It‚Äôs still relatively unstudied. Popular thinking is it may be more than the 2-4% currently thought to have it. Particularly if Social Media response is anything to go by. Like many things there‚Äôs a spectrum, For example, I may don‚Äôt see a red apple with my eyes closed, yet I dream in full colour 3D. My memory is very strong, I remember what people were wearing, what they said, did. I remember how I felt. I‚Äôve been designated ‚Äòkeeper of records‚Äô in our family,  Because I know what happened, when. I find visualisation techniques deeply frustrating, and now I know why! There is no red apple, or ‚Äògo back to a time in your childhood‚Äô picture for me. This provides an appreciation if conducting or on the receiving end of such visualisation processes,  That it‚Äôs not the person being difficult or resisting if they seem restless, they simply can‚Äôt see anything.  So, please tell me, what do you see? If you‚Äôre a 5 too, here‚Äôs a great article to learn more about this. https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/feb/26/what-is-aphantasia-like #aphantasia #closeyoureyes #visualization ",18700,90,9,47,0,"closeyoureyes,visualization,aphantasia",https://www.tiktok.com/@caromccourtie7/video/7445088713429765383

The ability picture things in your minds eye to the point you can move and manipulate them, touch them, smell them, and even taste them is known as hyperfantasia.  I see things to the point that I can imagine minute details. I use this while working out scenes for my books. Hopefully this translates onto the page as details in the story.  The inability to picture things in your mind is known as afantasia. If your mind works like this you don't form pictures when you think. You understand thoughts, memories and dreams as information, maybe words, maybe feelings, but no images. I know a few people with afantasia. It's hard to understand what other people perceive in there minds eye. However, there is nothing wrong with you no matter where you are on this scale. We are all different in our own unique and beautiful ways, so please don't think that I'm putting you down if you are anything other that at 1. I'm just interested to see where people are on this scale.  #mindseye #hyperfantasia #aphantasia #scale #imagination #whatdoyousee #fyp",4131,32,63,4,0,"scale,imagination,fyp,whatdoyousee,mindseye,aphantasia,hyperfantasia",https://www.tiktok.com/@pauljkearns_author/video/7443906571148479776

Everyone has that author or book that got them into reading, or returned them to it. For me, I have many for the different phases in my life. But the author who returned me to reading every day back in 2022 was @StephanieLight and her updates and backlog on Dreame (at the time). She‚Äôs now got some stories on Dreame and current ones on Inkitt, but securing trophies is nearly impossible‚Ä¶ Her worlds immerse you in Hispanic culture and feel like the homes I was welcomed into in my youth. Her characters experience immense trauma but they also exude extreme strength in the face of adversity. Stephanie has also surrounded herself with such a community of amazing authors that I entered a world of endless possibilities and realms. I found a community in the space she created when I was otherwise an island alone focused on raising tiny humans and who I was to everyone else. @Vera Foxx is one of those amazing authors who I now get to call a best friend, and when Steph was at a signing with her books, they worked together to make sure that I wouldn‚Äôt miss out on my many years goal of one day having Stephanie Light on my shelves. Thank you so much, words will never be enough for either of you. It won‚Äôt return Mateo or Emi or Doni to a HEA, but it brings my babies to my shelves to love and experience again and again (ok I wouldn‚Äôt dare risk hurting my trophies, but they here for me to love on). The art gives me the chance to finally see the characters and worlds Steph has built.

He helped her get back to normal, and win an olympic medal. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXsTnvvbRfg  2. I read an artilce on WebMd explaining how Marijuana use in pregnancy is associated with lower performance on thinking skills, impulse control, attention and planning in 5 year olds. It was also associated with more aggression. https://www.webmd.com/baby/news/20241029/marijuana-use-pregnancy-tied-kids-attention-anger-issues 3. I read an article on Indian Express.com that explained that groups of people with aphantasia, and groups of peope without aphantasia, were made to  listen to a forest full or birds, a crowd of people, and also a street full of traffic, blindfolded. For each scenario, people without aphantasia got a stronger response in parts of the brains visual cortex. So, aphantasic people have a weaker response in the brain's visual cortex, when they hear sounds blindfolded. https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/aphantasia-when-some-people-cannot-see-in-their-mind-9676673/ #changeyourbraineveryday #DANIELAMEN #alyshanewman #marijuna #marijuanapregnancy #aphantasia #cortexvisual #sound #minipodcast #podcastshow #newpodcast #podcasters #newepisode #podcasthost #podcasts #podcasting #podcastersoftiktok #podcastlife #podcastmovement #podcastcommunity",97,1,0,0,85,"sound,marijuna,newepisode,podcasts,danielamen,podcasting,minipodcast,podcasters,podcastshow,newpodcast,aphantasia,podcastlife,podcastersoftiktok,podcasthost,podcastmovement,podcastcommunity,alyshanewman,changeyourbraineveryday,cortexvisual,marijuanapregnancy",https://www.tiktok.com/@gabriellalaplace/video/7439748748864949560

7454043851121102087,denny_megs,1735529837,au,"Just another hurdle I have to literally sacrifice myself to get over.  It took me so long to realise that having mental blindness was in fact not normal.  Artists with Aphantasia find it difficult to draw from memory as in the most extreme cases (like myself) can only visualise context and ideas. We cannot see an image in our head and therefore making it extremely difficult to draw something from our minds eye.  I used to think it was just really bad artist block and then I realised I simply cannot see what I‚Äôm supposed to be drawing.

Here‚Äôs the thing: Most people think ‚Äòvisualizing‚Äô is JUST the ability to see pictures in their minds, but that‚Äôs not ALL it is. Successful visualization is about incorporating as many senses as you can (especially emotions), to immerse into the experience. ü¶ã  Part of my job as a hypnotherapist is to learn¬†how YOU visualize,¬†and use that info to create as much success as possible for you in each session. ‚ú® ¬† ü¶ã For bonus points, use this practice to visualize your ultimate business¬†or personal goal as if it were right here, right now...  üòå Feel the emotions of already having it...  üí∞ See the dollar amount in your bank balance...  üíÉüèº Notice what you‚Äôre wearing, how you carry yourself... your energy...  üëèüèº Who is around you, congratulating and supporting you?

Writing imaginatively at school was a nightmare and ‚Äòcounting sheep‚Äô when I couldn‚Äôt fall asleep at night made no sense at all.  It wasn‚Äôt until recently that I discovered that there was a name for the way in which my brain worked - Aphantasia. #Aphantasia is condition where people are unable to create visual images in their mind. People with aphantasia don't have a ""mind's eye"" and their imagination works differently. The available research indicates that aphantasia is uncommon overall. Experts estimate between 2% and 4% of people have it. However, research on this condition ‚Äî including how many people have it ‚Äî is limited. It‚Äôs also difficult to determine who has it because many people with aphantasia don‚Äôt realize they think in a way that‚Äôs different from most people. People with aphantasia may not realize that most people can ‚Äúsee‚Äù images they generate in their minds.  #bookishthoughts #avidreader #booktok #neurodivergent #romancereader ",448,38,16,1,67,"romancereader,neurodivergent,avidreader,booktok,aphantasia,bookishthoughts",https://www.tiktok.com/@tortured.readers.dept/video/7449096528192425249

A Quick Self-Test Step 1: The Apple Test Close your eyes and try to picture an apple. Now, rate how clear the image is: 5 ‚Äì As clear as a real apple, full of detail. 4 ‚Äì Fairly clear, but not as sharp as real life. 3 ‚Äì A little blurry, but you can tell it's an apple. 2 ‚Äì Very vague, like a shadow or outline. 1 ‚Äì No image at all‚Äîjust darkness or the word ""apple."" Step 2: The Beach Scene Now, imagine yourself on a beach. Can you see the waves? The sand? Feel the warmth of the sun? If you struggle to form a mental picture, this could be a sign of aphantasia. Step 3: The Face Test Try to visualize the face of a close friend or family member. Can you clearly see their features, or is it just a vague sense of their presence? Results Mostly 1s: You might have aphantasia, meaning you think conceptually rather than visually. Mostly 2s or 3s: You may have weaker mental imagery, but still some ability to visualize. Mostly 4s or 5s: You likely have strong mental imagery and can create vivid pictures in your mind.

I have aphantasia which means I have no mental image. So, I have to use a variety of senses, references and imagination to create something. I usually let the work itself show me the image it creates through acts of randomness. I have been experimenting with skulls and have come to love drawing/painting them. To me, they are my favorite subject matter because of the variety of meanings they evoke (and they‚Äôre the most fun to draw üòÖ). I encourage everyone to create, because art is for everyone. I also believe everyone should create no matter their skill level. Creating is freedom from the world and it allows people to outwardly express the multitude of feelings caged inside. #smallartist #art #creative #artist #create #painting #digitalart #procreate ",363,16,0,0,0,"art,artist,painting,creative,create,digitalart,procreate,smallartist",https://www.tiktok.com/@kaid_aquino/video/7468483283051941166

Are there any others out there that cannot see anything people tell them to picture in their mind‚Äôs eye and imagination that can relate to this? Please let me know.  I need to find others like me who also experience this.   I must see something in order for it to be real and visually pleasing to my soul.   I cannot simply picture things in my head.  This is probably why guided meditation doesn‚Äôt help me at all, but I do respond to music and sounds.   I have a difficult time enjoying books, remembering faces, movies and TV shows, because I cannot picture them in my head.   At least I am finding the powers that it gives me;  Like being extremely present in the moment so that I fully immerse myself into my experiences.  My senses are heightened pretty much all the time as a result as well. It‚Äôs also probably a good thing that I cannot picture my darkest days in my mind, so that I don‚Äôt have to deal with flashbacks I also wonder if this is why my dreams are so insanely vivid. At least I can see in my dreams which is most likely why they are so memorable.

Through healing, belief and connecting to self, you begin to break free from the hold it has over you and truly come into a position of the love and connection you have not experienced in many lifetimes. In our membership groups at Beyond Light Academy we are seeing this first hand and are truly proud of the progress these souls have made.

I thought it was just a turn of phrase, not that people could actually VISUALISE things in their head üôÉ that was wild when I discovered that people actually could ü§£ üßò I legitimately thought visualisation meditations just didn‚Äôt work‚Ä¶ but then I realised they don‚Äôt work if you can‚Äôt visualise anything üôä üì∏ For me, aphantasia has meant that photography is my way of being able to see places from my memories. I love taking photos of loved ones - my fianc√©, my friends and family - because I can‚Äôt just picture them in my mind like other people might. üé• I love to record little clips of regular life - of the flowers on my walk to town, of palm trees swaying in the wind, of things I see every day. üíî This audio definitely hits different if you have aphantasia. I KNOW why I take so many photos and videos. The fear of losing a memory by not having a permanent version of it as a photo or  a video is a real fear. Knowing that I can‚Äôt just imagine somewhere I‚Äôve been or something I‚Äôve done and see it in my head again gives me that desire to record everything. So for me, that‚Äôs my reason to take photos and videos of everything ü•π Did you know about aphantasia? Have you heard of it before? üí¨ Feel free to ask me any questions if you‚Äôre curious about aphantasia or what it‚Äôs like living with it!

Messy, real, human, and full of original ideas and characters.

As Adam Zeman delves into this thought-provoking concept, audiences are invited to reconsider the traditional understanding of mental health and visualization. Could aphantasia be more than just a unique way of experiencing the world? The animation by Manon David beautifully complements Zeman's insights, making complex ideas accessible and engaging.

This intriguing spectrum of mental imagery not only differentiates those with aphantasia from their hyperphantasic counterparts‚Äîwho experience visuals so intense they seem real‚Äîbut also hints at deeper psychological and neurological insights. Research reveals that individuals with aphantasia often don't see their pupils react when imagining light. This remarkable glimpse into how our minds work sheds light on why many aphantasics excel in STEM fields, while those with vivid imaginations often pursue careers in creative domains like art and design.

7473150311595609366,theliteraryescape,1739978400,gb,"What is aphantasia? It‚Äôs when your brain doesn‚Äôt create or use mental images. There are different ‚Äúlevels‚Äù to aphantasia e.g. someone might be able to visualize the outline of an apple or even an apple itself but without color, but someone else might not be able to visualize anything at all if someone told them to picture an apple in their mind.  I do think it was a protective trauma response of my body and it‚Äôs something I‚Äôll probably take a lot of time to overcome. It used to be significantly worse just a few years ago before I started therapy. I was one of those people who saw NOTHING in their mind.  It used to scare me because I worried I‚Äôd forget what the people I love look like if I didn‚Äôt have pictures to look at, and I worried that my writing would never connect with people because I didn‚Äôt think I could write rich descriptions. I know now that none of that is true. But it still affects my confidence in writing. I haven‚Äôt written my romantasy book yet because I‚Äôm scared I still won‚Äôt be able do it justice.

7490799006243671342,thelettucebussy,1744087616,US,"Clearing up some things from my last drawing vid: 1. I did not mean people who use references and copy their ‚Äòposes‚Äô for their drawings are not artists. I was specifically talking about MYSELF, how i don‚Äôt consider myself an artist because i have no originality nor creativity. I can only replicate exactly what i see if it‚Äôs already in a drawing format. Which, imo, makes me a fraud to the art community. Please take no offense to it, it was not directed towards anyone but me. 2. People were mentioning aphantasia. I do not claim to have this ‚Äúcondition‚Äù nor do i know enough about it to give a clear answer. I do want to address, i have an imagination and i have creative IDEAS but they‚Äôre not vivid enough for me to be able to jot it down on a piece of paper. Hence why i struggle sm with my artwork. 3. No, I do NOT trace my artwork. Granted, if you had asked me this when i was younger and more naive then I would‚Äôve responded with yes and still think that it‚Äôs okay to claim others hardwork as my own (i do not claim the drawings i make today as my own either) but as you can see in the video, i am able to draw what i see, exactly how i see it. Though, you can still tell it‚Äôs not EXACT, proving i do not trace. Nor do i condone it whatsever!! I use pinterest sketches only and i‚Äôve never seen a watermark so i have no idea who they belong to. I don‚Äôt go beyond sketching tbh cs i suck, lol. -Anyways, that‚Äôs all i wanted to talk about and no, no one has really come at me for these.

The power of imagination plays a significant role in the writing process and it‚Äôs far more common among writers than many may believe. In this insightful take, discover how your ability to visualize scenes is actually shared with a vast majority‚Äî96 to 98% of people, to be exact! Embrace this connection rather than feeling like an outsider in the writing community. Dive into the fun and unpredictable world of storytelling, where overthinking and romanticizing the craft can often lead to humorous and enlightening realizations.

Weirdly, they talked me out of it, saying it was too stressful and that I‚Äôd never be able to cope. (Wtf?! ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüßê) So I shelved it. I *DID* try to bin it, but the dream refused to stay in the bin. So it went on the shelf, where I could always still see it, but didn‚Äôt touch it.  And then things shifted in the last 2 years where I said, more and more, ‚Äúno. This is my dream. These are MY goals. I work so bloody hard, and I‚Äôm pretty damn good at what I do, and I‚Äôd like to be recognised for it.‚Äù In a sudden fit of ‚Äúemotional visualisation‚Äù (thanks #aphantasia) just after an orchestra rehearsal last weekend, I took a chair, set up my camera, sat down and played like the stage was mine. And holy shit, it felt completely unnatural. But then it felt REALLY GOOD.  Next time I plonk down a chair in front of an orchestra set up to play a solo?

In this video, we explore how to activate and build your Merkaba through intention, visualization, and energetic alignment. We begin by understanding the difference between material love and universal love, as a state of unconditional love is essential for Merkaba activation. The Kabbalistic Cross can serve as a tool for centering and aligning our energy. For those who don‚Äôt visualize images easily (aphantasia), we discuss alternative methods such as working with sacred geometry through art, crochet, or simply meditating on the mathematical patterns. Once the Merkaba is formed, two interlocking, counter-rotating tetrahedrons, you place yourself at its center and use thought to navigate through different dimensions. Beginners may start with small energetic shifts before venturing further into the higher planes. Join me in learning how to consciously activate your Merkaba and unlock your ability to explore beyond the physical! #merkaba #merkabaportal #merkabah #multidimensional #consciousness #brainwavefrequency #multidimensionalbeings #psychicabilities #thetastate ",12643,1158,73,158,171,,https://www.tiktok.com/@darling_bubbles/video/7485088477793520926

It‚Äôs not a problem, it‚Äôs just a way a person‚Äôs brain function. And huge part of the population doesn‚Äôt see images in their mind. Everything is informational.  You wonder, how do they enjoy reading?! Actually, many of them do. And people that have aphantasia can be amazing writers.  I have always had a vivid imagination. I could be in a conversation and see everything while the other person is talking. Furthermore, I‚Äôm an empath so I can feel it too! Although I do have limitations. It‚Äôs hard for me to imagine something I‚Äôve never seen before. Fantasy books take time for me to visualize.  Thankfully I‚Äôve learned to manage my emotions because it‚Äôs not healthy to feel everything. Separating my story from other people‚Äôs, especially fictional ones, is a crucial part in setting boundaries.  As for you, can you visualize what you are reading?

Aphantazija je stanje u kojem pojedinci ne mogu vizualizirati slike u svojim mislima. Dok veƒáina ljudi mo≈æe zatvoriti oƒçi i zamisliti predmete, lica, ili scene, osobe sa aphantazijom to ne mogu. Umjesto toga, njihova ""unutra≈°nja slika"" mo≈æe biti potpuno tamna ili se oslanjaju na verbalne ili konceptualne opisne metode da bi razumjeli svijet oko sebe. Nedavna istra≈æivanja su pokazala da ljudi sa aphantazijom imaju drugaƒçiju mo≈ædanu aktivnost u odnosu na one koji mogu vizualizirati. Kada se zamole da zamisle ne≈°to, kod osoba sa aphantazijom ne aktiviraju se isti dijelovi mozga koji su ukljuƒçeni u vizualizaciju kod drugih ljudi. Ovo sugerira da aphantazija nije samo razlika u subjektivnom iskustvu, veƒá ima i neurolo≈°ku osnovu. Iako aphantazija mo≈æe zvuƒçati kao ograniƒçenje, mnogi ljudi sa ovim stanjem vode potpuno normalne i uspje≈°ne ≈æivote. Neki ƒçak tvrde da im ova razlika poma≈æe da budu bolji u logiƒçkom razmi≈°ljanju ili da se manje ometaju emocionalnim slikama. Istra≈æivanje aphantazije poma≈æe nauƒçnicima da bolje razumiju kako mozak stvara i obraƒëuje mentalne slike, ≈°to mo≈æe imati implikacije za razumijevanje drugih neurolo≈°kih stanja. Aphantasia: People Who Can't Imagine Pictures in Their Head Have Different Brain Activity Than Those Who Can Aphantasia is a condition where individuals are unable to visualize images in their minds. While most people can close their eyes and imagine objects, faces, or scenes, those with aphantasia cannot. Instead, their ""mind's eye"" may be completely dark, or they rely on verbal or conceptual descriptive methods to understand the world around them. Recent research has shown that people with aphantasia have different brain activity compared to those who can visualize. When asked to imagine something, the brain regions associated with visualization do not activate in the same way in individuals with aphantasia. This suggests that aphantasia is not just a difference in subjective experience but has a neurological basis. Although aphantasia might sound like a limitation, many people with this condition lead completely normal and successful lives. Some even argue that this difference helps them excel in logical thinking or makes them less distracted by emotional imagery. Research into aphantasia helps scientists better understand how the brain creates and processes mental images, which could have implications for understanding other neurological conditions. #kaiko_bosnaa #aphantasia #memory #memories #brain #mozak #gehirn #pictures #brainactivity #mindseye #eye #eyes #humananatomy ",525,30,0,5,96,"memories,eye,eyes,pictures,brain,memory,humananatomy,mozak,gehirn,mindseye,aphantasia,brainactivity,kaiko_bosnaa",https://www.tiktok.com/@kaiko_bosnaa/video/7483279855019167031

Imagining Movement: Aphantasia‚Äôs Impact on Motor Simulations I watched a video from the Aphantasia Network explaining how imagining movement is different in the brain for aphantasics and non aphantasics. When phantasics did visual imagery their brain was more excited compared to their baseline levels, however, this did not happen for aphantasics. So, it was found out for higher level reading comprehension phantasics did better than aphantasics beacause they were able to visualize imagery. Moreover, phantasics were able to imagine movement, called kinesthetic motor imagery. It's when someone can feel the sensation of moving without moving, in their mind's eye. By doing that, they could train themselves to be better at that kinestheic task. However, aphantasics were not able to do any of that.   a. https://www.youtube.com/live/9egMuLqjEgA?si=DjPPKOi73zNJuBsf  b. https://aphantasia.com/video/motor-simulations/?srsltid=AfmBOoqGgBR_ERjmgKO7SKtJ1hf1VBJKihzoFx2R20tiV5Q2rNkiaubl #MiniPodcast  #PodcastTikTok #QuickPodcast #MicroPodcast #PodcastShorts #PodcastEpisode  #PodcastCommunity #beatshoogah #music #instrumentalmusic #instrumental #producer #firefighter #brain #amenclinics #aphantasia #kinesthetic #phantasia #imagining #movement",143,1,0,0,77,,https://www.tiktok.com/@gabriellalaplace/video/7483137175941319941

7503808879252360494,captainwigglepickle,1747116740,US,"üçéAppleüçé The rotating apple phenomenon refers to a common mental imagery test used to explore how vividly a person can visualize objects in their mind‚Äôs eye. When someone is asked to picture an apple slowly spinning in space, the task reveals not just their ability to recall visual details, but the very nature of how their brain processes imagery. Some people can clearly ‚Äúsee‚Äù the apple in their mind as if it were a real object, complete with lighting, color, and motion. If you cannot do this, then you might have Aphantasia, a condition where individuals are unable to form mental images in their minds. This exercise also taps into broader cognitive functions like memory, spatial awareness, and sensory imagination. The apple is a symbolic test of an individual‚Äôs internal visualization system. If someone walked into a room and was immediately asked to imagine an apple rotating in their head, they might second-guess whether they‚Äôre truly ‚Äúseeing‚Äù it or simply thinking about the idea of it. That moment of uncertainty reveals how subjective and fluid mental imagery can be. What one person calls visualization, another might experience more as an internal sense or feeling. The rotating apple is less about the apple itself and more about understanding how we internally model the world when our eyes are closed. #aphantasia #neurology #visualization ",14511,115,5,7,28,"visualization,neurology,aphantasia",https://www.tiktok.com/@captainwigglepickle/video/7503808879252360494

7501694029403278614,littlelemonseed,1746624254,IT,"Some weeks ago a family friend, an established artist in my hometown, visited and saw some of my bird and landscape paintings. He told me they have been really popular in the 1400s üòÖ and suggested I stopped using photos, paint more modern subjects and go outside with a chair to work. It know it wasn't meant with malice, just the reflection of his taste and approach. Tbh I do lack some technical foundations (especially with perspective) and I'm still building confidence with certain medias and subjects. But honestly... I'm not interested in abstract or modern art. It just doesn't resonate with me. I don't think using photos references a bad thing at all too! I suspect I might have aphantasia, which is a condition where the mind's eye is blank. I often know what I want to create but the image is fuzzy, shifting and hard to pin down unless I have something concrete to look at. Right now I'm also slowly working on a project that is built from several photos I took myself: moments where I couldn't stop to sketch but wanted to capture something. It's been heartwarming re-living some of those memories, while also having moments of ""uh?? why the heck did I take a picture of THAT?!"" üòÇ I think it's important to stay open to feedback, especially from people with more experience, yet it's also important to filter what's truly relevant to your path as not all advice is one size fits all. . . . #artistsoftiktok #artistjourney #mentalhealthmatters #watercolorartist",794,14,2,0,61,"mentalhealthmatters,watercolorartist,artistsoftiktok,artistjourney",https://www.tiktok.com/@littlelemonseed/video/7501694029403278614

Time Blocking ‚õîÔ∏è: Dividing your week or days into specific chunks of time for particular activities and tasks. This helps you prioritize, stay focused, and manage time efficiently.  1. Peak Productivity Period üß†: This is the time of day when you are often most locked in. First, you must recognize yourself as a morning or night person. If you don‚Äôt know already, experiment for however long you need to figure out what you are. Time block an hour to three in your morning or night. I do not recommend the afternoons (but experiment ofc), because most people are affected by the ‚Äúafternoon slump‚Äù. The ‚Äúafternoon slump‚Äù is a period in the afternoon when we are less productive, alert, and motivated. This is just part of our circadian rhythm. Recognizing this in yourself is a big step to becoming more productive throughout your day. I recommend time blocking your least intellectually demanding tasks during this time.  1. Pomodoro Technique (for practice) üçÖ: Set a timer for each exercise and focus for that much time. No distractions (airplane mode, cover clocks, quiet place). Take a short break (30s-5 mins) between each exercise to refresh your mind. The length of the break depends on the intensity of your focus.  1. 3 P‚Äôs üí™: Practice. Perceive. Pursue. I‚Äôve compounded these over the past three years and I can proudly say that the success I‚Äôve earned from them has far exceeded my expectations. What do they mean? Practice üìà: Practice your primary instrument for at least 20 minutes every day. If you can, get in 10 minutes of your secondary instrument. Ear training, sight reading, and sight singing are valuable skills to keep sharp. Remember, you can always practice in your head! (Idk if that works for people with aphantasia tho‚Ä¶) Perceive üß†: Listen to, watch, learn about, or discuss music every day. This can be anything music-related. Music business, effective practice. Maybe a composer‚Äôs writing process. (t least 15 minutes every day)  Pursue üôå: This is where the definition of luck comes in. ‚ÄúLuck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity‚Äù (Seneca). Pursuing includes content creation, attending a jam, gigging, talking to people at a show, and open mics. Literally anything where there is music and people involved.            #musicmajor #musicians #musiciansoftiktok #musicianslife #workingmusician #productivity #musicstudent ",210,12,0,0,21,"musicians,musicianslife,musicmajor,musicstudent,productivity,musiciansoftiktok,workingmusician",https://www.tiktok.com/@gregory.dervinis/video/7499642350046596382

We Are All Guilty Here was one hell of a wild ride. This felt like an episode of Criminal Minds, and I'm here for it. Karin Slaughter has done it yet again. I did not want to put this down. She somehow managed to make a 400+ page DARK thriller feel like it flew by. From the jump, I was hooked. We have our main character, Emmy Clifton, who is a police officer. At the annual Fourth of July parade, she is one of the first to arrive on the scene. Two girls have gone missing, and there is a lot of blood. One of them happens to be her best friend's step-daughter.  Emmy knows the statistics, but she'll do anything in her power to bring her best friends daughter home. Just as the title suggests, though, there are a number of possible suspects.  Twelve years later, an almost identical crime occurs in their small town. My favorite thing about Karin Slaughter is that she tackles difficult topics head-on. There are a lot of dark ones in this book (check your trigger warnings: ie, child abuse, extreme violence against children, kidnapping, loss of a parent.)  As someone who struggles to visualize things in my head (shout out aphantasia) I sometimes have a hard time feeling immersed, but I felt like I was right there working alongside Emmy Lou the whole time.@William Morrow Books #karinslaughter #thrillerbookrecs #thrillers #prettygirlskarinslaughter #thrillerbooktok #newbookrelease ",1024,70,11,13,76,"thrillers,newbookrelease,karinslaughter,thrillerbookrecs,thrillerbooktok,prettygirlskarinslaughter",https://www.tiktok.com/@readbysydney/video/7497235003345063199

Alleen zwart. Misschien een idee van een trap. Een woord. Een richting. Maar geen beeld. Nooit een beeld. Welkom in mijn brein. Dit is afantasie. Geen beeld. Geen film. Geen fout. Afantasie betekent: geen plaatjes in je hoofd. Geen innerlijke Netflix. Geen regenboogdeuren, gidsen of lichtstralen. Jij voelt, weet, resoneert ‚Äî maar je ziet niks. Je hoort het woord ""visualiseren"" en je voelt al weerstand. Want wat als je dat helemaal niet kunt? Wat als je hoofd geen scherm heeft om iets op te projecteren? En nee: dat is geen blokkade. Geen trauma. Geen tekort. Het is neurologisch. Zeldzaam. Slechts 2 tot 5% van de mensen heeft dit. Dus als je bij een groepsmeditatie weer de enige bent die niks ziet? Dan ben je niet kapot. Je bent gewoon anders bedraad. Anders afgestemd. Niet op beeld, maar op frequentie. Beeldvoelend. Niet beelddenkend. Ik zie niks. Maar ik voel alles. Een sfeer. Een trilling. Een energie. Geen visuals, wel waarheid. Geen plaatje, wel een explosie van weten in m'n lijf. Anderen zeggen: ""Ik zie het helemaal voor me."" Ik zeg dat ook weleens. Maar de waarheid? Ik zie het niet. Ik ben het. Mijn systeem √≠s het beeld. Zonder scherm. Zonder visuele input. Met rauw weten, zonder tussenlaag. Mijn hoofd maakt geen film. Mijn lijf maakt ruimte. Mijn systeem vangt op wat er speelt. Zonder het eerst te moeten zien. Hoe dat werkt? Wegbeschrijvingen? Chaos. Ik moet het lopen, voelen, ervaren. Geef me geen links en rechts. Geef me ankers. Ritme. Ori√´ntatie via gevoel. Visualisaties? Pure frustratie. Als je zegt ""stel je voor dat je een gouden licht om je heen ziet"", haak ik af. Want ik zie niks. Maar ik voel w√©l dat er iets gebeurt. Dus nee, ik ben niet geblokkeerd. Ik ben afgestemd op iets anders. Meditaties? Ik zie niks, maar mijn hele systeem staat open. Mijn lijf reageert. Mijn energie verandert. En dat is genoeg. En daarom werk ik anders Mijn activaties zijn geen sprookjes. Geen droomwerelden. Geen glitter en innerlijke schijnrealiteit. Wat ik breng, is trilling. Veld. Energie. Waarheid. Geen plaatjes, maar puls. Geen verhaallijn, maar direct veldcontact. En dat werkt. Dieper dan veel mensen verwachten. Juist omdat het niet afleidt. Omdat het niets probeert te laten zien. Alleen maar laat voelen. Voor beelddenkers ontstaat er een innerlijke reis. Voor beeldvoelers? Een lijfelijke waarheid. Zonder vertaling. Zonder masker. En dat is waarom dit ertoe doet Want we leven in een wereld die verslaafd is aan plaatjes. Aan zien. Aan projectie. Alles moet visueel zijn. Mooier, helderder, spectaculairder. Maar niet iedereen werkt zo. Sommige mensen werken van binnenuit. Zwart. Stil. Gelaagd. Echt. En in die echtheid zit de magie. Ik zie niks. Maar ik weet alles. Dus als jij niks ziet tijdens een meditatie: je bent niet geblokkeerd. Je bent anders. Je voelt. Je weet. Je resoneert. En d√°t is een superkracht. Een die niet op een scherm verschijnt, maar die in je veld wakker wordt. #afantasie #beeldvoelen #nietvisualiseren #spiritualiteitzonderplaatjes #andersbedraad #innerlijkweten #trillingbovenbeeld #energievoelen #veldwerk #diepwerken #rauwespiritualiteit #aphantasia ",1802,24,2,0,0,"aphantasia,afantasie,energievoelen,veldwerk,innerlijkweten,andersbedraad,rauwespiritualiteit,diepwerken,nietvisualiseren,trillingbovenbeeld,spiritualiteitzonderplaatjes,beeldvoelen",https://www.tiktok.com/@claudia_5d.shift/video/7497184533201030422

For centuries, Constantine, the demigod of dreams and nightmares, has been trapped in a prison dimension of cold, lonely darkness, betrayed by a once-beloved friend during the divine war. In this void, solace comes only from the flickering mortal dreams that drift through his head in broken pieces and the whispers of his raven spies. Yet, one radiant light cuts through his darkness: Kasta. For months, he has been entranced by her music, enchanted by the haunting melodies that flow from her violin. She's the only spark in his endless night, igniting a fierce longing for freedom that he thought was long frozen over. Then, on a moonless, storm-filled night, chaos erupts as portals tear open across the globe, calling forth demigods and titans to compete in the brutal Corinthian‚Äîa savage contest devised by the gods of Evernight. With a pantheon weary of their reign, the stakes have never been higher: the victor will ascend to godhood, taking the place of a tired deity ready for their ascension, while all others will fall. Kasta is thrust into this competition, bewildered by her summons‚Äîafter all, she's no demigod. Ten years ago, she awoke on the banks of a raging river, clutching her violin, saved by the Madame who raised her within the sultry walls of a high-class brothel. The haunting gaps in her memory torment her, but her music has always served as a shield against the desires of her patrons. Among the divine contenders, Constantine watches her. He's always close, his golden eyes seeing too much. They say he's the son of Chaos himself. He has a proposition for Kasta‚Äîone she's reluctant to take. But the chances of winning the Corinthian against demigods and titans are slim, and Constantine might be her only guarantee of survival. Not even a victory. Just survival. In the realm of Evernight, the Corinthian may very well claim them all. #booktoker #bookish #fantasyromancebooks #romantasybooktok #romantasybooks #booktok #smuttok #newrelease #romantasybookrecs #booktokfyp #aphantasia #artist #designer #artwork #graphicdesign ",66,7,0,0,15,"artist,designer,artwork,graphicdesign,newrelease,bookish,booktok,aphantasia,booktoker,booktokfyp,smuttok,fantasyromancebooks,romantasybooks,romantasybooktok,romantasybookrecs",https://www.tiktok.com/@penncassidy/video/7496603628761812270

7496224725140606238,caitd71,1745350864,us,"The Misinformation of Cameron Post was an incredible book, and one of the first I truly loved as a 20 year old lesbian trying get truly encapsulated by literature that relayed to my own experiences. I wished so much there wasn‚Äôt a dark twist in the book, but unfortunately the author felt differently (creators/authors always decide the lesbians need to either die or go through a horrific trauma‚Ä¶ or need to throw in a chapter about the lesbian questioning their gender. With all of that said, and with what I know now, I‚Äôd still give that book a 6/10 üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà. The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo was truly everything I have ever wanted to read in a book. It still pulls at the heartstrings of being a queer person in the celebrity snow globe, but each character is written beautifully. I cannot wait to see the film adaptation but am riddled with worry that the casting will focus too much on celebrities we already know and not enough on making Evelyn Hugo a fresh face. The twists in this book will genuinely give you shock factor moments, and they are worth every second. My favorite lesbian centered book I have ever (and likely will ever) read. I‚Äôve tried share with select others how incredible this book is and it‚Äôs their own fault if they never pick it up and give it a read. Their loss, truly. This book is always a 10/10 üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà  Three Lives of Cate Kay is the book I just finished about 30 minutes ago. It scratched the itch I‚Äôve had since finishing TSHoEH, although I did get a bit lost with the transitioning of characters so often within the book. This is a book of unrequited love confusion mixed with painstaking trauma the need for a new life. It is about love and loss and connecting back to who we were as children. If it weren‚Äôt for the confusion of the back and forth and ‚Äúnew names‚Äù of characters I would give this book a 9/10 üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà (honestly, I could still be convinced that‚Äôs the best rating) but since it takes a good bit of ‚Äúwho is that again‚Äù in the first half of the book I‚Äôve decided to settle for 8/10 üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà These are ALL worth reading!! Save TSHoEH for last! What other books have you read that have a lesbian main character and what ranking would you give them? I need to plan for a summer of laying in my hammock, enjoying the sunshine, and reading books that really transport me.  *note: I have pretty solid aphantasia, meaning I can‚Äôt visualize images in my mind almost at all, but definitely cannot wait detail. With that said, the better the book, the easier it is for me to stay invested in the story! #lgbt #BookTok #lgbtbooks #lgbtbooktok #lesbian #thesevenhusbandsofevelynhugo #themiseducationofcameronpost #thethreelivesofcatekay ",1159,39,5,3,0,"lgbt,lesbian,lgbtbooks,themiseducationofcameronpost,booktok,thesevenhusbandsofevelynhugo,lgbtbooktok,thethreelivesofcatekay",https://www.tiktok.com/@caitd71/video/7496224725140606238

Experience: People with aphantasia often describe their mind‚Äôs eye as completely blank. Example: If you ask someone with aphantasia to picture a red apple, they understand what an apple looks like but can‚Äôt see it in their mind. Phantasia Spectrum Mental imagery varies a lot from person to person. Most people fall somewhere in the middle of this spectrum:  Mild Phantasia: Can visualize a little, but not in great detail or clarity. Average Phantasia: Can visualize things fairly clearly, especially familiar objects or scenes. Vivid Phantasia: Images are very lifelike, almost like watching a movie in your head. Hyperphantasia Definition: Hyperphantasia is the opposite of aphantasia‚Äîpeople experience extremely vivid and detailed mental imagery. Experience: Mental pictures can be so clear they feel almost real. Example: When imagining a red apple, someone with hyperphantasia might see the gloss on the skin, droplets of water, and even feel the texture. Bonus Thought This spectrum doesn‚Äôt only apply to visual imagery.

In an earlier post I brought up the topic because there is a percentage of the population that can‚Äôt.  It‚Äôs called Aphantasia (AF-an-TAY-zh…ô) which is defined by wiki as - the inability to voluntarily visualize mental images.  Therefore, reading a novel or a six book series, just doesn‚Äôt have the same appeal. Not saying anyone who‚Äôs brain operates this way doesn‚Äôt enjoy reading, but I could understand if they didn‚Äôt love it. So maybe watching an adaptation of a book would be more satisfying.  There are stories and characters that are so compelling that you want everyone to experience them. For that reason, there are books I‚Äôd love to see making to the screen. It‚Äôs exciting to talk about storylines. And sometimes adaptations can reach more people. In turn, those people can become potential readers once they discover a books.  Here‚Äôs a list of movie/TV shows that were books first. 1. The Perfect Couple 2. Lie To Me 3. The Summer I turned Pretty  4. My Life With the Walter Boys 5. Fourth Wing 6. Quicksilver  7. Lord of the Rings 8. Lord of the Flies 9. Fifty Shades of Grey 10. Twilight  11. The Hunger Games 12. Ready Player One 13. Verity 14. It Ends With Us 15. The Walking Dead 16. Bridgerton 17.

I have aphantasia, which means I can‚Äôt visualize anything in my mind‚Äîno shapes, no scenes, no colors. So instead of ‚Äúseeing‚Äù a woman turn into a bird, I draw what that feels like. Started with a female, which gave me a thought I should make this into a family. A family where the women turned into a bird. Creating a story around it. Every line is guided by emotion, not a mental picture. It‚Äôs not planned‚Äîit unfolds. This isn‚Äôt what I imagined. It‚Äôs what emerged.  She was never just a woman. She became what they tried to cage. Feathers now where silence used to be. What happens when a woman turns into a bird? Not metaphorically‚Äîvisually. I can‚Äôt picture it in my head (I have aphantasia), so I let emotion guide every line. This is what it felt like, not what I imagined. And how I start a drawing.  Process My drawing process differs because of this condition. For me, my mind is completely blind(dark). When I try to imagine. I found that if I just start drawing on paper without thinking helps out my process on getting it on paper.  What is aphantasia? It‚Äôs a condition where I can‚Äôt picture things in my mind. No faces. No scenes. No imagination ‚Äúvisuals.‚Äù Just black. But that doesn‚Äôt stop me from creating. I draw from feeling, not mental images. Every line is a surprise‚Äîeven to me.

This piece is called ‚ÄòHostages.‚Äô It‚Äôs about the parts of ourselves we‚Äôre forced to hide. The smiles we wear because we‚Äôre told to‚Ä¶ The versions of us that feel safe enough to be seen. These aren‚Äôt just people. They‚Äôre copies. Rehearsed expressions. Manufactured emotions. They‚Äôve been stripped down‚Äî masked, duplicated, and pushed down the line like they‚Äôre not human anymore. That‚Äôs how it feels when you‚Äôre always performing. I made this with aphantasia. I can‚Äôt visualize anything. There‚Äôs no picture in my head‚Äî just movement, memory, and emotion. So I let the drawing reveal itself to me. I follow the feeling. This is what creating from a blind mind looks like. I live with aphantasia. That means I can‚Äôt visualize anything in my mind. No faces. No memories. No dreams I can picture. Just blank space. But that doesn‚Äôt stop me from creating. In fact, it completely changes how I create. This artwork didn‚Äôt start with a sketch in my head‚Äîit started with a feeling. I don‚Äôt see the final image before I begin. I just dive in. Every stroke is a decision made in the moment. Every figure is born from emotion, not memory. The process is chaotic, intuitive, and raw. ‚ÄúBlind Mind‚Äù reflects a world where expression is manufactured. Where smiles are copy-pasted, and identities are shaped to fit in. It‚Äôs about the pressure to conform, the fear of being different, and the loss of authenticity in a filtered world. The figures you see aren‚Äôt imagined‚Äîthey‚Äôre revealed. Each one represents a part of ourselves that feels hidden, masked, or reshaped to be acceptable. They‚Äôre not drawn from sight‚Äîthey‚Äôre drawn from truth. Aphantasia doesn‚Äôt mean I have no imagination. It just means my imagination looks different. It‚Äôs not something I see. It‚Äôs something I feel. So if you‚Äôve ever felt like your creativity doesn‚Äôt fit the mold‚Äî if your process is messy, emotional, nonlinear‚Äî you‚Äôre not broken. You‚Äôre just creating from a different kind of mind.

7513262066128538923,sydneydisme,1749317698,US,"üß† Definition 	‚Ä¢	Aphantasia comes from the Greek roots ‚Äúa‚Äù (without) and ‚Äúphantasia‚Äù (imagination). 	‚Ä¢	First formally described in 2015 by cognitive neurologist Adam Zeman. 	‚Ä¢	It refers specifically to voluntary imagery. People with aphantasia may still have involuntary imagery in dreams or flashbacks. ‚∏ª üîç Common Characteristics 	‚Ä¢	Inability to visualize familiar faces, places, or objects. 	‚Ä¢	Difficulty recalling visual aspects of memories (e.g., what your childhood home looked like). 	‚Ä¢	Often discovered when someone realizes other people can vividly picture things in their minds. 	‚Ä¢	May also affect other sensory imagination (like imagining sounds, smells, or touch)‚Äîthis is called multisensory aphantasia. ‚∏ª üß™ Diagnosis 	‚Ä¢	There is no brain scan or medical test to diagnose aphantasia. 	‚Ä¢	The most common assessment is the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ)‚Äîa self-report test asking how vividly you can imagine various scenes. 	‚Ä¢	Some brain imaging studies show reduced activity in visual cortex areas during mental imagery tasks. ‚∏ª üß¨ Causes & Origins 	‚Ä¢	Can be congenital (present from birth) or acquired (due to brain injury or trauma). 	‚Ä¢	There is growing evidence it may be linked to differences in brain connectivity, especially in areas that control voluntary imagery and memory. 	‚Ä¢	Not considered a disorder or illness, just a variation in human cognition. ‚∏ª üé® Cognition, Creativity & Memory 	‚Ä¢	People with aphantasia often rely more on conceptual, verbal, or logical thinking. 	‚Ä¢	Creativity is not impaired‚Äîmany artists, writers, and musicians have aphantasia. 	‚Ä¢	Some report weaker autobiographical memory, especially for visual scenes, but others have rich, detailed memories using different modalities. 	‚Ä¢	Some famous individuals believed to have had it include Ed Catmull (co-founder of Pixar) and Blake Ross (creator of Firefox). ‚∏ª üí≠ Opposite of Aphantasia 	‚Ä¢	Hyperphantasia is the ability to create extremely vivid and detailed mental images, almost like real perception. 	‚Ä¢	The spectrum ranges from aphantasia ‚Üí typical imagery ‚Üí hyperphantasia. ‚∏ª üõå Dreaming 	‚Ä¢	Many people with aphantasia can still dream in images, though some report fewer or less visual dreams. 	‚Ä¢	Dreaming seems to be controlled by different brain processes than voluntary mental imagery. ‚∏ª üë• Living with Aphantasia 	‚Ä¢	Often only becomes noticeable when others describe vivid mental imagery, prompting a comparison. 	‚Ä¢	Some find it frustrating or alienating, while others never missed what they never had. 	‚Ä¢	There are supportive communities online (like Reddit‚Äôs r/aphantasia), and research interest in the condition is growing.",399,7,2,0,0,,https://www.tiktok.com/@sydneydisme/video/7513262066128538923

I wanted to experiment with a slightly different way of colouring and sketching, I actually made my own brush and my experience drawing became so much less stressful?? I previously thought that brushes didn‚Äôt matter, but I ended up being wrong - making your own brushes is shockingly effective in assisting you with your own style. Anyways I started collecting Pok√©mon cards and I got a Rapidash card that was rendered beautifully, the flames were so nicely done that it inspired me to make something similar. I just used a basic reference of Charizard to make sure my proportions were accurate, but I forced myself to make the colours myself based on those references because it trains me to rely on my own knowledge rather than colour picking mindlessly. The reason I use references a lot is because it‚Äôs good for artists and I also have Aphantasia, which means I cannot imagine things - which is pretty ironic given that I‚Äôm an artist lol.  . #fyp #viral #art #pokemon #cool  ",325,40,1,0,0,"art,cool,viral,fyp,pokemon",https://www.tiktok.com/@theduckfortress/video/7512623156410993927

That means when I close my eyes, I don‚Äôt see anything. No pictures. No faces. No colors. Just total black. For most people, creativity starts in the ‚Äúmind‚Äôs eye‚Äù ‚Äî they can picture their characters, ideas, or scenes in their heads before ever putting pencil to paper. I‚Äôve never had that. I can‚Äôt visualize anything before I draw it. This reference shows two drawings side by side: üñº One made using a reference ‚Äî where I can interpret and build off something visual. üåÄ One drawn without any reference ‚Äî where I rely entirely on muscle memory, emotion, and instinct. My mind is essentially blind, but that doesn‚Äôt stop me from creating. Aphantasia just means my process is different. I don‚Äôt ‚Äúsee‚Äù the idea before I make it ‚Äî I discover it in real time, on the page. Whether you have a rich imagination or a completely blank canvas like mine, your creativity is still valid. Art doesn‚Äôt come from mental pictures ‚Äî it comes from expression, persistence, and passion. If you‚Äôve ever felt like your brain works differently when it comes to art, you‚Äôre not alone. üß† Have you ever heard of aphantasia before? üí¨ Can you picture things in your mind? Let me know in the comments! When I draw, it‚Äôs not from memory or imagination like most people. I either use references or build things piece by piece, figuring it out as I go. Instead of ‚Äúseeing‚Äù the image first, I rely on instinct, feeling, and years of practice to bring it to life. Every drawing you see started from a completely blank mental canvas ‚Äî no sketch in my head, no internal reference. Just a quiet mind and a loud imagination. ‚ú® This is what it looks like to create without a mind‚Äôs eye. You don‚Äôt need to ‚Äúsee it‚Äù in your head to be creative.

Practicing in your head üß†: You can do this anywhere, anytime. Visualize your instrument. Visualize your fingers, limbs, and voice. All parts of the body you use. Internally and externally. Play whatever you work on in your head. Try visualizing scale degrees, intervals, chords, melodies, and everything relevant to your music. (not sure how this works for people w/ aphantasia‚Ä¶) 2. Spaced Repetition ‚è±Ô∏è: If you‚Äôre in a time crunch, split your practice into multiple sessions a day for a length of time that works for you. (I do this). Rest for 30s, a minute, or 3 mins, depending on the intensity and length of the exercise. This allows your brain to replenish the neurotransmitters used during that focused period. Your unconscious mind will analyze what you just practiced, fixing mistakes and strengthening the neural connections associated with that task. During your break, you can just breathe, eat, and/or walk a little. Do not play during that period because it can confuse your brain, limiting the benefit you get from spaced repetition. Also bro, don‚Äôt scroll.  3. Minimize distractions üö´: Put your phone on airplane mode. Turn off all other electronics. Find a place where you can lock in.  4. Routine üìã: An effective routine has interleaving at its core. Interleaving is a learning technique of practicing different skills in proximity to one another. Saving time. A routine with stretches, a warm-up, 3-15 exercises/places of focus, is ideal. (at least for me). When making the routine, think about the order of exercises. Will practicing something before another help you with the following exercises? (I always practice scales and arpeggios before anything else) 5. Experiment üß™: Have fun! Explore your instruments. Explore what you know and don‚Äôt know. The best ideas come from a silent mind, when you least expect. You are inadvertently using this flowmodoro technique here.

Im not sure when but the first photo will be sold as a print in the future üòä  I decided to keep in all of my sketches because I was so surprised I could even draw a semi realistic person without looking at a reference. I have aphantasia and it's why I rely so much on photo reference but I'm so happy I've come far enough that I could do this for her.  It was also very fun to do something new and I'm honestly so endeared with her characters and I love the world building in her story.

Still pictures? Smells? Are you pulling only from memories, with nothing made up? This feels like a serious case of ‚Äúmy color blue isn‚Äôt your color blue,‚Äù and it‚Äôs completely changing how I think about communicating with people. This whole discovery started when I was talking to another parent, and she mentioned that she always had a hard time getting into reading as a kid. She just recently realized it‚Äôs because her mind doesn‚Äôt imagine or put her in the POV of the book the way it does for other people. She said she was reading Fourth Wing, and one of the dragons is described as yellow (along with other details), but since she had never seen a yellow dragon, her brain could only fill in the color yellow and nothing else. Every time the dragon came up, that‚Äôs all she saw. It wasn‚Äôt until she looked at fan art that she could finally picture the dragon in her head. Ever since that conversation, I‚Äôve been asking everyone I know what their brain‚Äôs default thought mode is. One of my favorite answers came from a friend who said his default is smell. It‚Äôs not that he can‚Äôt picture things, but he has to make a conscious effort to visualize. His brain goes to smell first. Meanwhile, I have to really work to think of or remember a smell. It just doesn‚Äôt come naturally to me. I honestly thought everyone experienced their thoughts like a movie. If I‚Äôm planning a meal for Thanksgiving, I‚Äôm actively cooking in my head and plating the dishes. My husband, on the other hand, sees just one or two still images. And some people see nothing at all! This is honestly blowing my mind. And is a strong argument for adapting the way we communicate and teach people.  AND if we really wanted to dig into it, it might be the root cause of some of our disagreements as people because we're literally viewing the world differently! Our brains are all on different radio waves. Maybe I was always destined to make videos because the way my brain thinks is like a movie.?? . . . #kelsewhatelse  #brainscience #aphantasia ",3597,297,45,35,85,"aphantasia,brainscience,kelsewhatelse",https://www.tiktok.com/@kelsewhatelse/video/7504454172524350766

7504147147974266158,_ben_too_clean_,1747195458,us,"Anfantasia, scientifically, refers to the absence of voluntary mental imagery. This means that individuals with aphantasia are unable to consciously visualize images, even when asked to imagine something familiar like a friend's face or a common object. Neurological and cognitive research suggests that aphantasia may arise from differences in how the brain processes and integrates information across various regions, particularly those involved in visual processing, memory, and attention. While the exact mechanisms are still being investigated, studies using neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) have shown that individuals with aphantasia may exhibit altered patterns of brain activity when attempting to visualize images compared to individuals who can readily conjure mental images. It's important to note that aphantasia exists on a spectrum, with some individuals experiencing a complete absence of mental imagery and others having varying degrees of difficulty or clarity in their visualizations. Additionally, aphantasia does not typically impair other cognitive functions such as memory, reasoning, or perception. People with aphantasia may simply rely on alternative cognitive strategies, such as verbal descriptions or conceptual knowledge, to navigate daily tasks and process information.",1450,45,4,1,0,,https://www.tiktok.com/@_ben_too_clean_/video/7504147147974266158

Leo Rising. üìå Life Path 33/6 ‚Äî the wounded teacher with a megaphone. üìå Sacral Generator with a 6/2 profile ‚Äî walking experimenter, high-level guide, hermit genius. üìå Born 4:44 PM. üìå Aphantasia. Touch-based memory. Sensory-mapped gridworker. üìå Nervous system built to feel everything and transmute it through fascia. I didn‚Äôt find this system in a book. I built it in my body. Over years of chronic pain, grief, and total life collapse. While others were gaslighting me, diagnosing me, dismissing me, I was reverse-engineering the truth: üß† Trauma lives in connective tissue. ‚ö° Frequency runs through fascia like current. ü™û Your chart reveals what your body will have to live out unless you consciously evolve it. I started massaging myself. Tracking emotional patterns. Mapping symptoms to seasons, memories, relationships. Then boom‚Äîclients started healing faster than any PT or doctor ever helped them. And I realized‚Ä¶ This wasn‚Äôt just about me. This was a global map, a nervous system upgrade, a collective reboot. üì° The Blueprint works because it‚Äôs based on your unique energetic coding. üß¨ Your astrology, numerology, human design, and physical symptoms are not separate. They‚Äôre the same song‚Äîjust playing through different instruments. When I learned how to interpret mine, I stopped fighting my wiring And started reprogramming the field. Now I help others do the same. Want yours? DM me or email roguehealingguide@gmail.com Sliding scale. Energy exchange. No gatekeeping.

7525592749760924950,beclearpro,1752188610,GB,"Ever been mid-conversation with someone, and they suddenly glance to the side, not at a screen, not at a person, just‚Ä¶ into space? I do this, a lot.  Specifically, I tend to look away and to the right when I‚Äôm thinking deeply or trying to articulate something complex. Some colleagues have even followed my gaze, wondering what I‚Äôm looking at (spoiler: it‚Äôs not a ghost or a hidden whiteboard). Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs really going on: It‚Äôs not distraction, it‚Äôs construction.   When I look away, I‚Äôm not disengaging. I‚Äôm actually building something. A sentence, a framework, a connection between ideas. It‚Äôs how I process and synthesise. Looking right often signals verbal or logical processing.  Neurologically, it‚Äôs linked to left-brain activity, like language, logic, and structured thought. For someone like me, who thinks in concepts more than images, it‚Äôs a natural shift. I also experience aphantasia - the inability to form mental images.  So when I ‚Äúpicture‚Äù something, it‚Äôs not visual. It‚Äôs verbal, abstract, conceptual. My gaze isn‚Äôt about seeing, it‚Äôs me navigating a mental map of logic and language. It‚Äôs also about managing cognitive load.   Eye contact is powerful but it‚Äôs also stimulating. Looking away helps me reduce external input so I can focus inward. Sometimes I‚Äôll even mention it in meetings if I sense it‚Äôs distracting:  ""I‚Äôm just thinking, I'm not distracted by something else"". It‚Äôs a small behaviour, but it says a lot about how we all process differently. Some people doodle. Some pace. Some stare into the middle distance like they‚Äôre decoding the Matrix. üí¨ Have you noticed your own ‚Äúthinking tells‚Äù?   Or spotted different behaviours in others?

My minds eye is completely black, and I can still be hypnotised. You might wonder how that‚Äôs possible..... But here‚Äôs the truth:  I dream vividly. Sometimes even lucidly. I access trance states, deep emotions, and symbolic insight, all without ever seeing  an image in my head.  Because hypnotherapy isn‚Äôt just about visualising.... It‚Äôs about sensing. Knowing. Feeling.  Trusting your own way of experiencing the world.  You don‚Äôt need to picture a beach to feel calm... You can hear it. Sense it. Imagine the idea of it, and still arrive exactly where you are meant to‚ö°Ô∏è  If your inner world is quiet or loud, vivid or blank, You‚Äôre not broken.You‚Äôre not blocked. You‚Äôre built differently.... And that‚Äôs not a barrier, it's still a way in... just one that is uniquely yours Whether your mind‚Äôs eye is a kaleidoscope or a void know this, you are still.....

This intriguing exploration dives deep into the phenomenon of aphantasia, where individuals can't conjure images in their minds as vividly as others. Through fascinating brain scan insights, we learn that while the visual areas of the brain may remain dormant in aphantasics during typical visualization tasks, something surprising happens when they dream. Interestingly, reading an exciting book elicits a physiological response in most people, but those with aphantasia don't experience the same sweat reaction. This uniqueness could even serve as a protective factor against certain mental disorders! Plus, there's a compelling link between aphantasia and careers in STEM, while hyperphantasia often leads to artistic pursuits.

Some researchers have suggested that aphantasia might not just be about ""mental pictures"" but could also involve a broader disconnection between sensory input and internal bodily signals. In this view, the brain's usual ability to simulate experiences ‚Äî visual, emotional, or physical ‚Äî might be disrupted in aphantasia because the integration between interoception and sensory imagination isn't functioning as expected. For example, if visualising a stressful scene usually causes your heart rate to increase or your breathing to shift slightly, someone with aphantasia may not experience that same internal bodily change. This possible link suggests that aphantasia could be part of a wider brain-body communication issue, where the system that normally blends sensory information with emotional or physiological responses is less responsive or out of sync. It‚Äôs an evolving area of research ‚Äî but one that could reshape how we understand both imagination and the physical self-awareness that supports it. #aphantasia #visual #women ",8899,306,15,37,75,"really,women,visual,aphantasia",https://www.tiktok.com/@drsermedmezher/video/7523678076417363222

Wanneer je je dit niet kan verbeelden, dan kan het zijn dat je aphantasia hebt. Wat is aphantasia? Aphantasia is een neurologische conditie waarbij de persoon niet beschikt over een verbeeldingsvermogen. Zo is het voor deze mensen moeilijk om schapen te tellen voordat ze in slaap vallen, of zich het gezicht van hun geliefde in te beelden. Zij hebben moeite met het synthetiseren van zintuigen in hun geest. Deze conditie is voor het eerst beschreven door de Britse Francis Galton in 1880. Tot 2015 is dit fenomeen nauwelijks bestudeerd geweest, waardoor er vrij weinig bekend is. Professor Adam Zeman gaf deze conditie zijn huidige benaming en schat dat 1 op de 50 mensen een milde tot sterke vorm van aphantasia heeft.",0,0,112,0,44,"phantasia,aphantasia,afantasie,dingenzieninjehoofd",https://www.tiktok.com/@dookje.engelhard/video/7522011041111264534

7521754745766300958,the.rogue.healer,1751295012,us,"Most people don‚Äôt need another diagnosis. They need someone to explain why their fascia is screaming, their nervous system is fried, and their emotions are stuck on loop. This is the theory that changed everything for me‚Äîand now it‚Äôs changing others: ‚∏ª üí° THE BASIC PREMISE: Fascia isn‚Äôt just tissue‚Äîit‚Äôs a living, mineral-rich, semi-conductive matrix that stores trauma, regulates energy, and controls how your body heals (or doesn‚Äôt). If it‚Äôs tight, dry, or stuck, you‚Äôre gonna feel like shit‚Äîphysically, emotionally, and energetically. ‚∏ª üîπ 1. Fascia is alive. It conducts electricity. It wraps every organ, muscle, nerve, and bone. It‚Äôs how your body talks to itself. When hydrated and mineralized, it flows. When it‚Äôs locked? It clogs your system like energetic scar tissue. üîπ 2. Trauma = frozen charge in fascia Talk therapy can‚Äôt touch it, because it‚Äôs not just mental‚Äîit‚Äôs biological memory stored in your tissue. Releasing it takes breath, movement, pressure, and safety. üîπ 3. Aphantasia made me better at this I can‚Äôt visualize. But I can feel. And that gave me hypersensitivity to fascia feedback most people miss. üîπ 4. Pressure + movement = activation Fascia isn‚Äôt passive. You have to interact with it. Sessions that involve the client‚Äôs participation? That‚Äôs where healing locks in. üîπ 5. Red light + minerals = internal power-up Red light fuels mitochondria. Magnesium + potassium turn your fascia into a live wire instead of a dead zone. Combined, they create conductivity. üîπ 6. Make the body a conductor Hydration, movement, minerals, red light, and intentional touch = a body that heals itself. Fascia stores energy. You just have to turn it back on. üîπ 7. Healing = reconnection You can‚Äôt heal a body you‚Äôre disconnected from. Fascia requires presence. Cannabis, grounding, breathwork‚Äîthey create a portal back into the system. üîπ 8. Fascia is the missing link in mystery illnesses Most chronic stuff isn‚Äôt imaginary‚Äîit‚Äôs just not visible on a scan. Fascia adhesions block lymph, hormones, nerve flow, detox, and gut function. üîπ 9. We forgot our animal instincts Animals shake, stretch, and tremble to reset. Humans suppress the process. We‚Äôre the only species trying to think our way out of trauma. ‚ÄúIf a dog‚Äôs fascia gets tight, it shakes. A human? We sit in it for 20 years.‚Äù üîπ 10. Our world is fascia-hostile Sitting, screens, synthetic light, nutrient loss, no movement, no earth contact‚Äîour bodies are out of context. And when fascia gets stuck, your brain gets foggy. What you call anxiety might be physical blockage. ‚∏ª üî• KELSEY‚ÄôS ROGUE HEALING METHOD: ‚úîÔ∏è Mineral loading (especially magnesium) ‚úîÔ∏è Cannabis (to reconnect and soften) ‚úîÔ∏è Red light therapy ‚úîÔ∏è Conscious movement + tension tracking ‚úîÔ∏è Manual fascia work ‚úîÔ∏è Nervous system education ‚úîÔ∏è Somatic + emotional release ‚∏ª ‚ö†Ô∏è Final Note: You‚Äôre not broken. You‚Äôre bound. Fascia is the body‚Äôs lost language‚Äîand when you speak it with breath, pressure, intention, and minerals, the body starts healing itself. This isn‚Äôt woo. It‚Äôs electrical.

7521254865700424991,phtmndraws,1751178642,us,"I always ask myself the same questions when I‚Äôm drawing‚Ä¶ cause it affects how I create concepts onto paper. Instead of staring down at my paper to decide what I want to draw, I simply need to start drawing even with hesitation. I never know what I‚Äôm creating but I draw till I feel finished or my paper is filled.  Aphantasia is a condition where a person is unable to form mental images in their mind‚Äôs eye. In other words, people with aphantasia can‚Äôt visualize things mentally‚Äîeven when asked to imagine a familiar face, place, or object, their mind may be blank. Here‚Äôs a breakdown: Key Traits of Aphantasia: 	‚Ä¢	You might understand what something looks like, but you can‚Äôt ‚Äúsee‚Äù it in your mind. 	‚Ä¢	It can affect voluntary mental imagery, like imagining a sunset or recalling someone‚Äôs face. 	‚Ä¢	It does not affect memory or intelligence‚Äîyou can still remember facts and details, but without picturing them. 	‚Ä¢	People often don‚Äôt realize they have it until it‚Äôs compared to how others visualize. Common Experiences: 	‚Ä¢	Struggling with guided meditations or visualizations. 	‚Ä¢	Having vivid dreams less often, or not at all. 	‚Ä¢	Difficulty in drawing from imagination (though some with aphantasia are skilled artists and work from reference or internal logic). It exists on a spectrum: 	‚Ä¢	Some people have partial aphantasia, meaning they might see vague shapes or flashes. 	‚Ä¢	Others have hyperphantasia, the opposite, where mental images are extremely vivid. Aphantasia does affect creative work‚Äîbut not in the way most people think. Many highly creative people have aphantasia; they just work differently. Here‚Äôs how it might influence your creative process: üîÑ How Aphantasia Can Change the Creative Workflow: 1. Less Mental Visualization, More External Creation 	‚Ä¢	You might rely more on reference photos, sketches, or experimentation. 	‚Ä¢	Instead of picturing a final piece, you build it step by step, making adjustments as you go. 	‚Ä¢	Artists with aphantasia often say they ‚Äúthink in concepts, not pictures.‚Äù 2. Strong Focus on Structure, Logic, and Symbolism 	‚Ä¢	Without visual imagination, your brain may lean into design, storytelling, emotion, or abstraction. 	‚Ä¢	You might use visual rules, memory of spatial relationships, or intuition to construct scenes. 3. More Sensory or Conceptual Creativity 	‚Ä¢	Some with aphantasia have heightened creativity in sound, language, texture, or narrative. 	‚Ä¢	You might create based on mood, theme, or feeling, not how something ‚Äúlooks‚Äù in your mind. ‚∏ª üí°Potential Strengths in Creative Work with Aphantasia: 	‚Ä¢	Originality: You don‚Äôt recreate mental images‚Äîyou invent through process. 	‚Ä¢	Clarity of concept: Ideas often come as meaning or structure, not foggy visuals. 	‚Ä¢	Excellent problem-solving: You test and refine ideas visually on paper/screen, leading to unexpected results. ‚∏ª üß† Real-Life Workarounds and Tips: 	‚Ä¢	Use moodboards, thumbnails, photo refs, or even 3D tools like Blender to help plan visuals. 	‚Ä¢	Try writing or voice-noting your ideas in words, then translating them into visuals. 	‚Ä¢	Keep a visual inspiration folder to spark ideas when ‚Äúnothing comes to mind.‚Äù üîç Creating Without Visualization or Reference (with Aphantasia) üåü What Might Be Happening: 	‚Ä¢	You‚Äôre not seeing an image in your head‚Äîbut you‚Äôre feeling an idea, a vibe, or a concept. 	‚Ä¢	You‚Äôre making creative decisions in real time‚Äîlike sculpting your way through the unknown. 	‚Ä¢	Your work might be built on: 	‚Ä¢	Emotion or storytelling 	‚Ä¢	Muscle memory and practice 	‚Ä¢	Design logic (e.g. balance, contrast, flow) 	‚Ä¢	A kind of inner ‚Äúblueprint‚Äù you can‚Äôt see but know how to follow.  #artist #aphantasia #artwithoutreference #AphantasiaArtist #mindblind #creativeprocess #creatingwithoutseeing #phtmndraws #artistsoftiktok #artistthoughts #arttok #fyp #foryoupage #drawingtok #explained #whyidraw #viral #creative #dailypost #makeithappen #pov #mymind #illustrator ",0,0,0,0,0,"artist,dailypost,viral,creative,mymind,makeithappen,pov,fyp,explained,illustrator,mindblind,creativeprocess,whyidraw,foryoupage,artistsoftiktok,arttok,aphantasia,drawingtok,artistthoughts,aphantasiaartist,artwithoutreference,phtmndraws,creatingwithoutseeing",https://www.tiktok.com/@phtmndraws/video/7521254865700424991

No hay visualizaciones. No hay ‚Äúpel√≠cula mental‚Äù. Lo supe hace poco. Siempre pens√© que cuando alguien dec√≠a ‚Äúimagin√° una playa‚Äù, lo que hac√≠amos todos era un ejercicio simb√≥lico o #emocional . Nunca supe que la mayor√≠a de las personas realmente ven algo con los ojos cerrados. Me enter√© que tengo #afantas√≠a y fue como abrir una puerta que nunca supe que exist√≠a. Como #creativo, fue un sacud√≥n. No porque me limitara, sino porque me hizo reordenar c√≥mo entiendo mis procesos. Nunca ‚Äúvi‚Äù las cosas antes de crearlas, y sin embargo toda mi vida trabaj√© con im√°genes. El #dise√±o, para m√≠, siempre fue corporal. Siento el peso de los elementos en el espacio. Reconozco ritmos, tensiones, equilibrios. Pero no tengo im√°genes internas. Y no las necesito. Mi #creatividad no se construye desde el ver, sino desde el hacer. Desde lo que me atraviesa f√≠sicamente. ‚∏ª üîé ¬øQu√© es la afantas√≠a? La afantas√≠a es la incapacidad de generar im√°genes mentales voluntarias. Se estima que entre 1% y 3,9% de la poblaci√≥n mundial la tiene. Muchas personas la descubren de adultas, y suelen confundirse porque s√≠ pueden so√±ar, como es mi caso. ‚∏ª üìç ¬øC√≥mo puede afectar? 	‚Ä¢	No afecta la #inteligencia ni la creatividad. 	‚Ä¢	Influye en la forma de #recordar , so√±ar o procesar #emociones . 	‚Ä¢	Muchas personas con afantas√≠a recuerdan por ideas, palabras, secuencias‚Ä¶ pero no por escenas. 	‚Ä¢	Algunas no pueden evocar rostros o paisajes en su mente, lo que puede generar cierta distancia emocional si no se entiende. ‚∏ª üìå ¬øQu√© hacer si te identific√°s? 	‚Ä¢	No entres en p√°nico. No es una enfermedad. 	‚Ä¢	Habl√° con profesionales si sent√≠s confusi√≥n o angustia. 	‚Ä¢	Pod√©s hacer el test de la manzana (VVIQ) como primera aproximaci√≥n: https://aphantasia.com/vviq 	‚Ä¢	Explor√° tu imaginaci√≥n desde otros sentidos: lo t√°ctil, lo auditivo, lo kinest√©sico, lo l√≥gico, lo sensorial. ‚∏ª ü§ç Yo no imagino como otros, pero eso no me impide crear. Solo me recuerda que todos creamos desde lugares distintos. Y entender c√≥mo funcionamos es el primer paso para dejar de compararnos con est√°ndares que no nos representan. ‚∏ª ¬øY vos?
