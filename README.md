# Online Discussion of Aphantasia and Hyperphantasia

Aphantasia refers to the absence of voluntary visual imagery, whereas hyperphantasia describes unusually vivid, “photo-like” imagery. Despite increasing academic interest, many individuals remain unaware of these conditions due to their low prevalence and the inherently subjective nature of mental imagery. With the rise of social media, however, online platforms have become important spaces where affected individuals share their experiences, raise awareness, and build supportive communities.

This study analyzes social media discussions of aphantasia and hyperphantasia on Reddit and TikTok using topic modeling (LDA and BERTopic) and sentiment analysis (RoBERTa and VADER). The dataset includes 1,614 Reddit posts, 22,883 comments, 2,005 TikTok videos, and 65,256 comments.

The findings reveal several key themes, including perceptual and sensory experiences, creativity and expression, and the practical adaptations individuals employ in everyday life. While discussions generally carried a supportive and positive tone, users also described the challenges and emotional burdens of lacking or possessing overly vivid mental imagery. Importantly, participants with typical imagery often expressed curiosity and empathy, highlighting the role of social media as a safe, peer-driven space for validation, advice, and public education.

By combining computational analysis with large-scale social media data, this study provides novel insights into the lived experiences of individuals with aphantasia and hyperphantasia, contributing to broader debates on neurodiversity and mental imagery.
